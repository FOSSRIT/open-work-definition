## **Why Are We Using The Term** **Open Work?**

People produce and collaborate on all different types of work within academia and beyond. Different types of works can be released and developed among communities of practice in different ways. To treat each type of Open Work as its own silo hinders the ability for these works to be used interchangeably among each other. We use the term Open Work to talk about a larger theory of practice in which Works of all types are developed, distributed, and collaborated upon.

## **Open Work Definition Version 0.1**

An **Open Work** delineates the meaning of “**Open**” with respect to work products and projects that are released into the public domain or under a license recognized by an entity such as, but not limited to, the[ Open Source Initiative](https://opensource.org/licenses) (OSI),[ the Free Software Foundation GNU](https://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-faq.html),[ the Creative Commons](https://creativecommons.org/) (CC) or[ the Open Knowledge Foundation](https://opendefinition.org/) (OKF) with the intent of promoting a robust community of collaboration around the work itself and other work that it may interoperate with. 

This essential meaning of “Open” aligns with that in the[ Open Source Definition](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Open_Source_Definition) and is synonymous with “free” or “libre” as in the[ Free Software Definition](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Free_Software_Definition) and[ Definition of Free Cultural Works](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Definition_of_Free_Cultural_Works).

The term “**Work”** will be used to denote the item or piece of knowledge being transferred.

The term **license** refers to the legal conditions under which the work is provided.

The term **public domain** denotes the absence of copyright and similar restrictions, whether by default or waiver of all such conditions.

The goal of the defining “Open Work” is to provide a meta, or unifying, term across the uses of Open Science, Open Research, Open Scholarship and other terms that attempt to encompass (yet end up excluding some of) the practices and spirit of the following

* Open Access Journals
* Open Data
* Open Design
* Open Educational Resources
* Open Hardware
* Open Innovation
* Open Intellectual Property
* Open Research
* Open Scholarship
* Open Science
* Open Source Software

A secondary goal is to reduce the use (and dilution) of “Open Source” (a term and definition specific to software) in application to domains to which it doesn’t apply, or it’s use as a verb; such as in “I’d like to “Open Source” this.” no matter what the “this” in question happens to be.

**The Roots of “Open Work”**

The intellectual “Family Tree” of the term Open Work includes examples from technology, science, and the arts.

**Technology:**

* [Distribution Religion](http://criticalartware.net/DistributionReligion/DistributionReligion.pdf): Arguably the first “Open Hardware” license, from the manual/instructions for the[ Sandin Image Processor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sandin_Image_Processor)) (1976-1978)
* [CopyLeft](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Copyleft):[ Li-Chen Wang](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Li-Chen_Wang)'s Palo Alto[ Tiny BASIC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tiny_BASIC) (1976)
* [Free Software, the FSF and the GPL:](https://www.fsf.org/)[ Richard Stallman](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Stallman) et al beginning in 1984-Present
* [Open Source](https://opensource.com/article/18/2/coining-term-open-source-software): The term coined by[ Christine Peterson](https://opensource.com/users/christine-peterson) and the creation of the[ Open Software Initiative](https://opensource.org/history), 1998

**Science:**

* “The Scientific Method,” dated at any point from the time of Aristotle to the early 1900s, depending on which history of the practices one subscribes to.

**Literature and the Arts**

* Umberto Eco's "[The Open Work](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/280730233_Text_and_Meaning_in_Umberto_Eco's_The_Open_Work)" is art with "two constituents: a multiplicity of meanings and the participation of the audience.
